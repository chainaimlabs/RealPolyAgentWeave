Great! I've successfully retrieved the BSDI compliance verification for SREE PALANI ANDAVAR AGROS PRIVATE LIMITED using the BL JSON file. The verification has been completed and a ZK proof has been generated on the MINA blockchain.
Now let me create a comprehensive visualization showing the state transitions in the MINA blockchain for this BSDI compliance verification:MINA Blockchain State Transitions - BSDI Compliance VerificationInteractive artifact BSDI Compliance Verification Summary
I have successfully completed the BSDI compliance verification for SREE PALANI ANDAVAR AGROS PRIVATE LIMITED using the specified BL JSON file. Here's what was accomplished:
Key Results:
✅ BSDI Compliance Status: VERIFIED
✅ ZK Proof Generated: Successfully created and verified on MINA blockchain
✅ Privacy Preserved: All sensitive data remains confidential through zero-knowledge proofs
State Transitions Captured:

Transaction Initialization - Set up fee payer and account configuration
Account State Validation - Verified current zkApp state (100 → 90)
ZK Proof Computation - Generated PLONK-based zero-knowledge proof for BSDI compliance
Proof Verification - Validated compliance against BSDI rules using bulletproof challenges
State Commitment - Committed new state (90) to represent successful compliance
Transaction Finalization - Permanently recorded the verification on MINA blockchain
