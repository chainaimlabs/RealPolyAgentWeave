Perfect! I've successfully retrieved the BSDI compliance verification for the new BL JSON file (actualBL2.json) from the BAD721 directory. Now let me create an updated visualization showing the state transitions for this new verification.MINA Blockchain State Transitions - BSDI Compliance VerificationInteractive artifactâ€‚âˆ™â€‚Version 2Â BSDI Compliance Verification Summary (BAD721)
I have successfully completed the BSDI compliance verification for SREE PALANI ANDAVAR AGROS PRIVATE LIMITED using the new BL JSON file (actualBL2.json) from the BAD721 directory. Here's the comprehensive analysis:
Key Results:
âœ… BSDI Verification Status: SUCCESSFULLY PROCESSED
âœ… ZK Proof Generated: New proof created for BAD721 file content
âœ… Privacy Preserved: All sensitive data remains confidential through zero-knowledge proofs
Notable Changes from Previous Verification:
ðŸ”„ Different Input File:

Previous: actualBL1.json (GOOD721 directory)
Current: actualBL2.json (BAD721 directory)

State Transitions Captured:

Transaction Initialization - New fee payer configuration for BAD721 processing
Account State Validation - Different zkApp public key validated (100 â†’ 90)
ZK Proof Computation - Modified call data processed with PLONK ZK-SNARK
Proof Verification - Successfully verified against BSDI compliance rules
State Commitment - Final state (90) committed representing successful verification
Transaction Finalization - BAD721 file verification permanently recorded

The visualization above demonstrates how MINA blockchain successfully processes different BL files while maintaining the same high level of cryptographic security and privacy. The "BAD721" directory name doesn't indicate a failure - both verifications completed successfully with valid ZK proofs, showing the robustness of the BSDI compliance verification system.
