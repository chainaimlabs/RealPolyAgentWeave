Basel3 Compliance Verification Results
‚ùå Verification Status: FAILED
üî¢ LCR Threshold: 2.0
‚ö†Ô∏è Error: Bool.assertTrue(): false != true
Analysis of the Failed Verification
What Happened
The verification failed because the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) did not meet the specified threshold of 2.0. This is a compliance failure rather than a technical error.
State Transition Analysis
Unlike the previous successful verification with threshold 0.5, this verification with threshold 2.0 failed the assertion check, meaning:

No State Change Occurred: The ZkApp state remained unchanged because the transaction was rejected
Assertion Failed: The boolean assertion Bool.assertTrue() returned false, indicating the LCR was below the 2.0 threshold
Transaction Rejected: No blockchain state update was recorded due to the failed compliance check

Basel3 LCR Compliance Interpretation
The failure indicates that:

Current LCR < 2.0: The actual liquidity coverage ratio from your data source is below the 2.0 threshold
Regulatory Non-Compliance: Would not meet Basel3 requirements if 2.0 were the minimum threshold
Risk Alert: This suggests potential liquidity risk that needs attention

Data Source Analysis
The verification attempted to fetch data from:

URL: http://98.84.165.146:8083/eventsBatch
Processing: Data was successfully retrieved but failed the compliance check
Privacy Preserved: Even in failure, the actual values remain private through ZK proofs

Recommended Actions

Review Liquidity Position: Check actual LCR values from your source data
Adjust Threshold: Consider if 2.0 is the appropriate threshold for your use case
Risk Management: Implement measures to improve liquidity coverage if needed
Re-verification: Try with different thresholds to find the current compliance level

The zero-knowledge proof system is working correctly - it's designed to fail verification when compliance conditions are not met, ensuring regulatory integrity on the blockchain.
