Perfect! I've successfully retrieved the GLEIF verification with cryptographic proof for SREE PALANI ANDAVAR AGROS PRIVATE LIMITED on the TESTNET. This demonstrates the complete state transition in the MINA blockchain.
GLEIF Verification Summary
Company Information

Company Name: SREE PALANI ANDAVAR AGROS PRIVATE LIMITED
Network: TESTNET
Verification Status: âœ… VERIFIED

Zero-Knowledge Proof Details
Public Input/Output Analysis

Public Input: [0] - Initial verification state
Public Output: Contains encoded company name and LEI data in ASCII format:

Company name: "SREE PALANI ANDAVAR AGROS PRIVATE LIMITED" (encoded as ASCII values 83,82,69,69,32,80,65...)
LEI Number: "894500Q32QG6KKGMMI95" (encoded at the end of the output array)



Cryptographic Proof Structure
The proof contains several key components that demonstrate the state transition in MINA blockchain:

Proof State: Contains deferred values, feature flags, and bulletproof challenges
Commitments: Multiple cryptographic commitments (w_comm, z_comm, t_comm) that ensure data integrity
Evaluations: Field elements proving the computation was performed correctly
Bulletproof: Zero-knowledge range proofs ensuring privacy while proving validity

State Transition Verification

Max Proofs Verified: 0 (initial state)
Proof Format: Base64 encoded zero-knowledge proof
Verification Method: PLONK-based proving system with bulletproofs
Security Features:

Range checks enabled
Foreign field operations verified
Lookup tables for efficient verification



Blockchain Integration
This verification demonstrates that:

The company's GLEIF compliance data has been cryptographically verified
A zero-knowledge proof has been generated confirming the verification
The proof can be submitted to the MINA blockchain for permanent, verifiable record
The state transition from unverified (input: 0) to verified (output: company data) is mathematically proven

The verification provides cryptographic certainty that SREE PALANI ANDAVAR AGROS PRIVATE LIMITED meets GLEIF compliance requirements while maintaining privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.
